This project is the finalized product from the "Build an android marker app using GeoJSON data"

See link here: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/android-markers-from-geojson/

This tutorial covers a common UX pattern for Android mapping apps, adding map markers from external data using GeoJSON and presenting additional information about the marker on tap with a slide-in UI panel using ModalBottomSheet.

Your final map will include markers over 3 coffee shops in Providence, which you can tap to find out more information about the business.
