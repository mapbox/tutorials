# React - Toggle Layers

You'll learn how to:
- Add a map to a webpage using React & Vite.
- Load data from a GeoJSON file
- Create separate layers based on matching property data
- Create toggles for each layer and onChange, toggle the related layer's visibility.
- Create an all toggle that will turn all layers on and off
- Create a pop up on click for the markers, adjust pointer visuals according to hover state and close out pop-up when toggling layers.
