## Flutter Getting Started App

Welcome to the Flutter Getting Started tutorial! This repository contains a simple Flutter application designed to introduce you to the basics of Flutter development. You can find this tutorial on the Mapbox website: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/getting-started-flutter/.

### What You'll Learn

- Add the Mapbox Maps SDK for Flutter to your project
- Display a map with a custom camera position
- Configure the Standard style with custom lighting
- Add interactive map features that respond to user taps
- Display your own data on the map with custom styling
- Enable user location with a pulsing indicator

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) installed (usually included with Flutter)
- An IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A [Mapbox Account](https://console.mapbox.com) and Access Token

#### Add your Access Token 
As outlined in the [Install Guide](https://docs.mapbox.com/flutter/maps/guides/install/) you **must** configure your public token to make requests to Mapbox services. Find your token in the [Mapbox Console](https://console.mapbox.com).

### Custom GeoJSON and GPX Data

This app uses custom GeoJSON data held in the `rio_marathon.geojson` file in the `assets` folder in this directory.
